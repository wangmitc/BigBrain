**Accessible typography - Font choice:**
Through the use of the google Poppins font, we were able to improve usability and accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities since  "Some popular fonts, such as Poppins, have proven to be readable with individuals who have cognitive disabilities."

**Colour - contrast:**
The three primary colours used in our website are:
- #f7595a
- black 
- white
and the secondary colours are:
- #f35586
- #f4f4f4
Since the blacks and whites are predominately used for the background and text with the watermelon red colour used as an accent
we have used good colour contrast throughout increasing our website usability and accessibility.

**Hovering a clickable elements:**
Any buttons that are evidently clickable such as "Play", "Edit", “Delete”, "Save changes" and “submit” are shaped clearly like a button and change opacity or colour with a change of cursor to show that they are clickable buttons to perform an action. Overall, these changes also help with usability and accessibility as it makes it clear what elements on the page are clickable.

**Shadows on the quizzes:**
Through implementing a hoverable shadow on the quizzes on the dashboard it is clear for the user to know what quiz their cursor is currently 
hovering on and what is the current focus on the screen. This also draws attention to the quiz they are currently on, increasing useability.

**Nav bar:**
Through creating a navigation bar with textual prompts and icons, it is clear to the user what options are available within the website. Overall, this increases usability and accessibility of our website as it is clear and easy on how to navigate throughout the website.

**Image - Alt text:**
Through implementing alt text for all images used to convey the “why” of the image as it relates to the content of the webpage, while also enabling screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a person with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, or who is otherwise unable to view the images on the page. Evidently, increasing the usability and accessibility of our website.
	
**Indication of required fields:**
Through adding a asterisk next to the labels of required field, it is clear to the used which field of input are required. This ultimately increases the usability of our website.

**Error modal**
Through having an error modal that displays a clear message as to where validation failed due to user input it is clear what mistake the user made and how they can fix it for next time. Furthermore, in using modals the error does not disappear after a certain amount of time and it is up to the user when the wish to close the error message, hence, improving usability.

**Focused input box**
Through having input boxes that have the label move to the top of the box when typing in it and it also having the label and border change colour it is clear when the user is focused within a textbox. Evidently, increasing the usability and accessibility of our website.

**Keyboard compatibility**
Through implementing keyboard navigation accessibility, the experience of using our site is improved for those who are unable or prefer not to use a mouse, the keyboard is a primary method of navigating a computer. Other assistive technologies also rely on keyboard accessibility, including voice recognition and screen readers. Hence, by ensuring our site is keyboard compatible we have improved the accessibility and usability in our site.
